# Code for Droplet Image Analysis:
- This code is written in MATLAB 
- clone this repository https://github.com/nagulmeera07/Image_processing_code.git into your MATLAB working directory
- Requires Image Processing Tool Box installed in MATLAB 
- This code usefull for the determination of Sauter Mean Diameter(SMD) of droplets in an image taken by the shadowgraphy Technique (Shadows of the droplets (2d) 'Assumed perfect Sphere' ). Resolution and Defocussed droplets consideration can be set bu user.
- Code is capable process a sinlge image and determine the SMD of collective droplets present in that Image. it can also takes any number of images and calculate the SMD of each image and averages over the all images. 
- Keep all the files in same Folder including images being processed.
